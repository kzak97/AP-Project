# AP-Project

We have made a Hospital Managemnet System. Complete Proposal was submitted through email in .png format before its deadline. Since most of it was handwritten, so I could not upload it here. Only a part of it which was in soft copy has been uploaded.

We have used an online JSON SERVER at localhost:3000. 
First we had install Nodejs. Then from its command prompt we opened our db.json database on its server by typing the command:
json-server --watch db.json

Then we used urls to implement our APIs. Different Tables are stored in db.json files in JSON format.

for writing the code we simply used netbeans. Our code is in JAVA.
